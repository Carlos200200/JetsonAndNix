NEXT STEPS:


For the final part of the intership i propose the following jobs:

1. Make a 2nd Benchmark

2. Wrapped the 2 Benchmarks on Nix

3. See how we can export a library in a easiest way on Nix.


Week -> Actions

1-2	Jacobi Benchmark (cuda)
3-4	Libraries on Nix: Exporting this benchmarks on Nix
5-6	It is possible to export a Nix Package more easy like Spack? (part1)
	- The global creation of a Nix Package
7-8	It is possible to export a Nix Package more easy like Spack? (part2)
	- The association of the Nix Package creation elements
9	Putting all together (writing the process)

*I know that the week 6 and 7 is possible that nobody is here, so thats why this part is of lecture and split on 2 parts, but if you see is more or less a month of the research.
