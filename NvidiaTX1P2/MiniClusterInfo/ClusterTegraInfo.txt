## Mini-Cluster Jetson Tegra TX1
#################################

The little cluster of 8 NVIDIA Jetson's TX1 is connected with a switch and use the computer to store the data, there is an imaging telling this connections and the number of each Tegra.

#Accessing:

All the Tegras can accessed via ssh using "ssh nvidia@Tegra<x>" where <x> is one of the 8 tegras.

	ssh nvidia@Tegra1	-> Also could be inside one of the Tegras
	ssh nvidia@Tegra2

# Access the NFS file:

The NFS file is called "cloud" and is on:

	carlos@dukas: cd ~/cloud

And on the Tegras are the cloud file to mount this file:

	nvidia@Tegra1: cd ~/cloud

But for the "activating" this mount we have to do 3 commands.

	sudo mount -t nfs MasterHosts:/home/carlos/cloud /home/nvidia/cloud
	eval "$(ssh-agent)"
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/Tegra1Key

Without that they can't connect to the NFS File and they can't "ssh" between the NVIDIA Jetsons.

# Access NIX File:

All the NVIDIA Tegra have the "Nix Store" via NFS (~/cloud/nix) inside the normal "Nix Store". This file are on /etc/fstab/ and to activate have to run the command,

	sudo mount -a

EXCEPT Tegra4 that has its own Nix Store without NFS.

# Password

The password is the standart on the system, "nvidia".

# Tegra4: Special Case

The Tegra4 has a special case of configuration due to in this tegra we try the Jacobi Benchmark derivation that spend a lot disk space. Thats the reason that we have a disk drive with all the OS in this Tegra.
